Fully functional (local and cloud) backend for execution in AWS Lambda and AWS
API Gateway, and deployed using GitHub Actions using the `serverless` tool.

Generated using [Scaffoldly Bootstrap](https://docs.scaffold.ly/).

### Features

- Serverless: Managed deployments to Lambda and API Gateway using GitHub actions
- Express: Familar backend API for Node, but wired up to work on API Gateway
- OpenAPI: Uses tsoa to take decorated controllers to auto-generate and serve
  API specification
- AuthN/AuthZ: Integrated with `sly-auth-api` in this organization for
  centralized authentication/authorization
- Service Discovery: `scaffoldly-bootstrap` managed configuration files in
  `./scaffoldly` for simple service discovery

# Getting Started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. Open the project in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and press `F5` to run.

# OpenAPI Auto-Generation

Using [Decorators](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/getting-started.html#defining-a-simple-controller)
from tsoa on controllers in `./src/controllers`, an OpenAPI v3 specification is
automatically generated:

- On Save (in VSCode)
- `yarn openapi` command

The OpenAPI file is hosted at http://localhost:3000/{service-name}/openapi.json

Frontend services use this predictable URL to auto-generate client libraries.

# Releases

## Non-Live Releases

Check-ins to `main` automatically trigger a non-live deploy which can be
observed in _Actions > Nonlive Deploy_.

Non-live releases are automatically versioned and draft releases are created.

## Live Releases

Each non-live release creates a draft release in GitHub (located in the
_Releases_ section to the right.

To trigger a release, edit the Draft Release and choose _Publish_.

The release can be observed in _Actions > Nonlive Deploy_.
